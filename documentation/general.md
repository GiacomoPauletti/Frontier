## GENERAL OVERVIEW
* Homebrew computer designed to be implemented with TTL
* 16-bit data width (16-bit registers)
* 16-bit address bus -> 64KiB addressable memory
	* Instruction memory and data memory are different addressign space
		* 64KiB for data memory (DM)
		* 64KiB for instruction memory (IM)
	* More details in *instructions.md* and *memory.md*
* Designed for xx MHz clock speed [WORK-ON-PROGRESS]
* Device communication via dedicated I/O [WORK-ON-PROGRESS]
